WSJF_Grid
=========================

## Overview
Weighted Shortest Job First Grid
This app displays a grid that shows the values used to calculate the WSJF score, 
and then calculate the score. The values in the grid are editable, but the score is not as it is 
calculated based on the values. The columns are sortable, so for example if you want to sort by Score, just
click on the "Score" column.


The Details:
The app is designed to work with Portfolio Items of type "Feature". No other filtering is handled,
but could be added.
The WSJF score calculation is ( Time Value + OERR + User Value)/ Job Size (rounded to nearest integer)
The app assumes Portfolio Items include the following custom integer fields. Make sure the following names are
entered into the Display Name of the integer field. If you change the display name to something else,
be sure to update the app accordingly.

Time Value <br>
OERR <br>
User Value <br>
Job Size <br>
Score <br>
